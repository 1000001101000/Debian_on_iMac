Tools for installing Debian on older iMacs

Note: none of this actually works yet, I'm still working through understanding how making USB images boot on these devices withoout messing with the bootloader.

For complicated reasons my WFH computer has ended up being an iMac from circa 2009 running Debian Buster. It is working surpisingly well overall but the initial install/setup was a bit of a pain. As is my habit I'm putting together a custom installer for the next time I perform an install, most likely when I install an SSD.
