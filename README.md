Tools for installing Debian on older iMacs

For complicated reasons my WFH computer has ended up being an iMac from circa 2009 running Debian Buster. It is working surpisingly well overall but the initial install/setup was a bit of a pain. As is my habit I'm putting together a custom installer for the next time I perform an install, most likely when I install an SSD.
